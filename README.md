# sentiment_analysis_tensorflow
This is my first python project based on machine learning.

"This project demonstrates sentiment analysis of text data using deep learning techniques with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the project was to develop a sentiment classification model using a deep learning approach.

The IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset was utilized as the dataset for training the model. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, a deep learning model was constructed to classify sentiment in movie reviews. The project utilized the power of these libraries to handle the complexities of neural networks and natural language processing.

The Jupyter Notebook environment was employed for data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Through iterative experimentation and fine-tuning, the accuracy of the sentiment classification model was improved by 8% compared to the initial results.

The code and implementation details are available in this repository, making it a valuable resource for those interested in sentiment analysis, deep learning, and natural language processing using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras."
